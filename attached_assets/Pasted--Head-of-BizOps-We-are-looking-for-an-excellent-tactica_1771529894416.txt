# Head of BizOps

We are looking for an excellent tactical professional to be an extension of the leadership team on the operations side of the business. As the hub of the operations wheel, you will keep the trains running on time while keeping a clear analytical view of how the business is performing.

Job descriptions usually aren’t very helpful. Here are the things you probably care about:

- Suffice it to say you’ll be a one-person operations department, and therefore your influence will be significant. You’ll report directly to the CEO. You’ll also manage external resources like recruiters, VAs, accountants, lawyers, etc.
- We have the beginnings of a cool company culture that you’ll help operationalize and contribute to.
- We’ve developed an industry-leading product our existing customers love & depend on. We’re at the cusp of a seismic shift in a $200B industry. You’ll be instrumental in helping the leadership team define an important category that will impact the lives of billions of people.
- Everybody on the team is smart and down-to-earth. We don’t hire anyone with a history of being a jerk (we check references).
- You won’t be micromanaged. You’ll be given objectives, context, and a supportive team, and expected to take ownership & be accountable for results, including proactively flagging issues and inconsistencies in data.
- We’re a remote company, and we lean into the strengths of virtual work. For example, we do a lot of asynchronous work through writing, messaging, etc. We travel once or twice yearly to get together for team meet-ups.
- There are things that are broken, fires burning, missing data, etc. (we don’t expect you to be perfect either). We expect you to bring a “let’s figure this out” mentality to solving problems.
- We offer comprehensive benefits, including health, dental, vision, travel stipend, no PTO cap, and parental leave.

We try to only hire people who will do the work of their lives at Trinsic. Here are the things we care about:

- Operations is where the “rubber meets the road” as far as culture is concerned. You must exemplify our culture.
- You’re a problem solver first and foremost and can tackle a diverse range of things punctually and without too much oversight.
- At least 3 years of experience in finance, operations, or a similar role. Startup experience is a bonus.
- Effective at accomplishing tasks quickly. Proficient with Microsoft Office (especially Excel), QuickBooks, payroll/HR software, project management software like Notion/Airtable/etc, and other back office tools. We’ll provide some training on tools you’re unfamiliar with but we expect you to be resourceful & a fast learner.
- Data-driven and comfortable doing analysis, tracking KPIs, and creating/managing dashboards and reporting on a regular basis. Comfortable working directly in spreadsheets, databases, and other systems to query & analyze data.
- A strong communicator, particularly in written form.
- Highly driven disposition, self-motivation, comfort taking action in ambiguity. You enjoy being a problem solver who can be resourceful to find answers to questions and automate things that you frequently do.
- This is an administrative role—it requires a “nothing is beneath me” mentality. You wrangle all the things needed to ensure things get done on time. You’ll also implicitly be a leader in the company.
- You should be comfortable managing people, both internal and external, including setting high expectations, holding compassionate accountability, and following through.
- We expect you to get smart about our industry to help us make good decisions. You need the aptitude to become fluent in how to speak to our product over time.
- You should be ambitious and have a desire to grow quickly, as our company grows. Demonstrated high-growth in the past, such as experience at venture-backed, early-stage startups, is preferred.

Your mandate will be to help create an organization where people can do the work of their lives. Here are some specific things that fall in that bucket:

- Oversee certain finance operations, including equity, AP/AR, taxes, and accounting systems, etc. You don’t need to be a CPA, but you’ll need financial acumen to work independently with our external accountants.
- Own ongoing business reporting: weekly metrics, KPI reviews, board-level reporting, etc. Naturally curious, you should independently drill in to numbers and be able to explain changes in performance.
- Operationalize the rhythm of the business, including finance and HR processes, all-hands, sprint planning, board meetings, off-sites, investor updates, etc.
- Work with hiring managers at Trinsic to define roles, structure interview processes, manage recruiters, create offer letters, and onboard new employees as needed.
- Aggressively take, triage, automate, delegate anything administrative or operational from the team’s plate. For example, vendor onboarding, equity administration, insurance, etc. (the list goes on)., with a focus on building processes instead of one-off fixes.

We are an EOO employer.
